# MD_v_MC
A Comparative study of the sampling efficiency of MD and MC simulations for a LJ fluid. It is observed that MC provides a better sampling for low density systems, whereas MD simulations became
comparable or marginally better than MC at higher densities. MC simulations are also able to predict dynamics when move sizes are small.
